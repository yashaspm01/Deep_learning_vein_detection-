# Deep_learning_vein_detection-
 Deep learning-based vein recognition system using a Siamese Network and Triplet Loss
 

## **🔍 Overview**  
This project implements a **deep learning-based vein recognition system** for secure authentication. Unlike fingerprints or facial recognition, vein patterns are **unique, hidden under the skin, and difficult to replicate**, making them a more secure biometric authentication method.  

The system utilizes a **Siamese Network with Triplet Loss** for **one-shot learning**, allowing it to authenticate users based on a **single stored vein image**.

## **🚀 Features**  
✅ **Secure Authentication:** Compares real-time vein scans with stored images for identity verification.  
✅ **Deep Learning-Based:** Uses **Siamese Network and Triplet Loss Model** to extract vein patterns.  
✅ **High Accuracy:** Trained on a **large vein image dataset** for better performance.  
✅ **Real-Time Processing:** Compares images using **structural similarity (SSIM) & Euclidean distance**.  
✅ **Impossible to Forge:** Unlike fingerprints, vein patterns are **invisible and cannot be lifted**.

## **📌 Project Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Image Acquisition**  
- User uploads a **vein scan image** for authentication.  
- The stored vein image from the **backend database** is retrieved.  

### **2️⃣ Image Preprocessing**  
- Converts images to **grayscale**.  
- Resizes to **128x128 pixels**.  
- Normalizes pixel values.  

### **3️⃣ Deep Learning Model (Siamese Network & Triplet Loss)**  
- **Feature Extraction:** The model learns vein patterns.  
- **Comparison:** It calculates the distance between the authentication image and the stored image.  
- **Decision Making:** If the similarity score is **above the threshold**, authentication is successful.  

### **4️⃣ Results & Performance Visualization**  
- Displays **training loss, accuracy graphs, and similarity scores**.  
- **Confusion matrix** is used to evaluate model performance.  

### **5️⃣ Authentication & Output**  
- If the user's vein matches the stored image, **access is granted**.  
- Otherwise, **authentication fails**.  

---

## **📸 Example Output**  
- **Similarity Score:** `0.89` (Authentication Successful ✅)  
- **Similarity Score:** `0.30` (Authentication Failed ❌)  
- Graphs: Training Loss, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix  
- Visual Comparison of Vein Images
